## About The Project

This Flask application allows users to submit information about cafes, including name, location, opening/closing times, and ratings for coffee, Wi-Fi, and power availability. The information is then stored in a CSV file and displayed on a cafes list page.

## Built With

Python


## Usage

- The script opens a Chrome browser window to fill out the form.

- Be mindful of scraping practices and terms of service for the websites involved.

- Consider error handling for potential exceptions during scraping or form filling.

## Roadmap
